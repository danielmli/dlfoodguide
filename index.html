        <p>Lol this exists because I was bored one day and wanted to practice making a website so here you go!</p>
        <p>一个吃货写的迪士尼吃货攻略</p>

            <h2>Part I: Table Service and Mobile Order</h2>
            <p><a href="#food">Go directly to the food</a></p>
            <p>Three types of places you can get food at:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>stalls</strong> (e.g. popcorn, churros, pretzels, turkey legs)</li>
                    <li><strong>quick-service</strong> (order at counter, get food, find somewhere to sit)</li>
                    <li><strong>table-service</strong> (host stand, server, whole deal)</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Realistically speaking you'll be eating at quick-service restaurants because of several reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>relatively good 性价比. table-service food is generally pretty overpriced</li>
                    <li>it's conveient and located all around</li>
                    <li><strong>it's impossible to get reservations for the good table-service restaurants</strong></li>
                </ol>
            <p>reservations are made by people up to 60 days in advance through the app (speaking of which, GET THE APP). You can also join walk-up lists for the table-service restaurants through the app, but those are really really hard to get. If you are trying though, here are generally the top tier ones to try for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#lamplight">Lamplight Lounge</a> (DCA)</li>
                    <li><a href="#cafeorleans">Café Orleans</a> (DL)</li>
                    <li><a href="#bluebayou">Blue Bayou</a> (DL)</li>
                    <li><a href="#cantina">Oga's Cantina</a> (DL)</li>
                    <li><a href="carthay">Carthay Circle</a> (DCA)</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Mobile Ordering</h3>
            <p>REMINDER AGAIN TO DOWNLOAD THE APP AND REGISTER!!!! Majority of quick-service places also do mobile ordering. You pick a time frame, order through your phone, and avoid the lines basically. pretty nice.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="item">
            <h2 id="food">Pt II: Disneyland</h2>
            <p>Here are the places in Disneyland, what I like from them, and stuff. If it's not here assume I haven't eaten it</p>
            <div class="list">

                <div class="place"><strong>Bengal Barbeque</strong>
                <p>Solid. Pork Belly and Bacon-wrapped asparagus are favs. don't bother with chicken</p></div>

                <div class="place"><em>Tiki Juice Bar</em>
                <p>Famous for pineapple dole whip. Good for your lactose friends. Pretty good by itself but i'm not a fan of the float</p>
                </div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Harbour Galley</strong>
                <p>Bread bowls are a good bet (it's mostly bread but it's good). Heard the Lobster Rolls were pretty good but haven't tried</p></div>

                <div class="place"><em>Edelweiss Snacks</em>
                <p>Turkey Legs are a classic but you can get them elsewhere. Chimichangas are surprisingly good</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Stage Door Café</strong>
                <p>Bruh Disneyland has the best corn dogs. get them here or at the Red Wagon near main st usa.</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Plaza Inn</strong>
                <p>Fried chicken and grilled cheese w/ tomato basil soup is good</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>French Market</strong>
                <p>My old go-to. Bread Bowls are pretty good and filling</p></div>

                <div class="place"><em>Mint Julep Bar</em>
                <p>Beignets are good and Instagrammable. Mint Juleps are a really sweet minty lemonade. I like it.</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Docking Bay 7</strong>
                <p>Beef Pot roast is pretty good. Only thing I've tried though.</p></div>

                <div class="place"><em>Milk Stand</em>
                <p>lol these are fucking weird but if you're a star wars fan u should try them for funsies.</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Pizza Planet</strong>
                <p>Don't bother. cafeteria-level pizza</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Galaxtic Grill</strong>
                <p>Solidly Okay. Burgers are solid but you're paying $12–$13 for something the size of a McDonalds Big Mac</p></div>

                <div class="place"><em>Churro Carts</em>
                <p>Disneyland sells the best churros and you can't convince me otherwise. No need to bother with the special ones some carts sell. the OG is good enuf</p></div>

            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="item">
             <h2>Pt III: California Adventure (DCA)</h2>
             <div class="list">

                 <div class="place"><strong>Pym Tasting Lab</strong>
                <p>for alc. The regulator is good (mango w/ a bit of spice). Molecular Meldown is good if u like stouts. DO NOT GET PARTICLE FIZZ</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Pym Test Kitchen</strong>
                <p>Pretty solid. Pym-ini Sandwich and chicken sandwhich is good. Impossible Spoonful is very very average. Don't bother with Quantum pretzel unless instagramming because it's fucking huge - if u really want a pretzel get an atomic fusion pretzel instead or a plain one from a cart. </p></div>

                <div class="place"><em>Schwarma Palace</em>
                <p>Both options here are REALLY GOOD but REALLY EXPENSIVE for what they are. If the one inside avengers campus has too long a line there is another cart in front of Hyperion theatre.</p></div>

                <div class="place"><em>Terran Treats</em>
                <p>THE CHURROS HERE MAKE YOUR POOP BRIGHT GREEN LMAO</p></div>
    
                <div class="place"><em>Cozy Cone Motel</em>
                <p>People like chili cone queso and the mac and cheese but it's OKAY—fun to instagram. They have dill pickle popcorn though which is pretty good</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Flo's V8 Cafe</strong>
                <p>It's okay. The fried chicken is pretty good though. It's a great photo spot at night near park closing when people aren't around it </p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Award Weiners</strong>
                <p>both good and okay at the same time. I once got a corn dog from here and it felt not as good as DL side. The Chili Dog was pretty good though</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Lucky Fortune Cookery</strong>
                <p>bulgogi burrito was solid and was pretty good in portion size</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>Pacific Wharf Cafe</strong>
                <p>Bread bowl is pretty good, shrimp roll also not bad</p></div>
             </div>
         </div>
         <div class="item">
            <h2>DCA's Holiday Foods!</h2>
            <p>Festival of Holidays is going on rn at DCA! They'll ahve a bunch of food stalls set up with some pretty good food. </p><p>You can buy the items individually for $6–9 but they also sell <b>Sip and Savor Passes</b> with 8 tabs that you can redeem for food items at the stalls. It goes for $56 i think. If you guys normally don't eat a lot one pass is probably a good for two people? The portions aren't that big though so yeah</p>
            <div class="list">
                <div class="place"><strong>1. Holiday Duets</strong>
                <p>Adobo was really good, especially if they give you a fatty piece. Shrimp & Grits also good if you like that sort of thing</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>2. Brews and Bites</strong>
                <p>Will try soon</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>3. Winder Sliderland</strong>
                <p>the turkey slider and pot roast are both really good</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>4. Making Spirits Bright</strong>
                    <p>have not tried</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>5. Grandma's Recipes</strong>
                <p>Will try soon</p></div>
            
                <div class="place"><strong>6. A Twist on Tradition</strong>
                <p>The wellington is good, but more of a piece of puff pastry with stroganoff on top. Tots were solid</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>7. Favorite Things</strong>
                <p>Mac & Cheese was pretty good. don't bother with the Masala</p></div>

                <div class="place"><strong>8. Merry Mashups</strong>
                <p>Mac & Cheese was good. Haven't tried the wings.</p></div>
